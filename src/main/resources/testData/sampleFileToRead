It is exciting times for the Selenium community as we have a lot of new features and enhancements that make Selenium WebDriver even more usable and scalable for practical use cases.
Selenium is a suite of tools designed to support different user groups:
Selenium IDE supports rapid test development, and doesn’t require extensive programming knowledge
WebDriver provides a friendly and flexible API for browser automation in most major programming languages
Grid makes it possible to distribute and run your tests across more than just one machine.
